# Summary:
The context menu items "Open PowerShell window here" and "Execute with PowerShell" do not sanitize the input path. If a user open PowerShell through the context menu in a malicious folder/share, it can lead to the execution of another script / binary.

# Description:

The context menu item "Open PowerShell window here" and "Execute with PowerShell" does not sanitize the input path. <br>
If a user open PowerShell through the context menu in a malicious folder/share, it can lead to the execution of another script / binary. <br>
PowerShell will append the folder name to the command line. PowerShell will try to execute the folder name.

# Impact:
An attacker could create a malicious file and a malicious folder. If a user try to execute the script inside the folder, it will execute the malicious file instead.

# Demo:
## Dumb version: 
![Command injection in the filename](ExecuteWithPowershell.gif)

## Pentest version:
![Slightly less dumb version](LocalFile.gif)

# Steps to Reproduce:

## Command injection in the filename:
1. Create a share/folder with the following name : MyFolder **'$(calc.exe)'**
2. Explore this share/folder with the explorer (double click on the folder).
3. Create a powershell file (New File > myscript.ps1).
4. Use the context menu, "Run with Powershell".
5. Powershell fails to execute the script. It leads to the execution of the payload (calc.exe in this case).

## Execution of a local file:
1. Create a share/folder with the following name : **build**'#Master
2. Explore this share/folder with the explorer (double click on the folder).
3. Create a powershell file (New File > myscript.ps1).
4. Use the context menu, "Run with Powershell".
5. Powershell fails to execute the script.
6. Windows tries to resolve the file "build", it runs "build.cmd".

# Intended behavior:
The Powershell should sanitize the path and execute the script.

# Microsoft Security Response Center Response:
Microsoft has decided that it will not be fixing this vulnerability in the current version and we are closing this case.â€¯ In this case this is due to the heavy target interaction required.

    Edition    Windows 10 Pro N
